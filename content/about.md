My name is Alex and I am a fourth year studying Computer Science and History at the
University of Virginia.
I am interested in a variety of things, from the vim-emacs debate, to the
history of technology, to dockerizing anything and everything.
Some of my non-technological interests range from reading, I am always down for good
book recommendations, to teaching and exploring.
Feel free to reach out if you have interesting views of any of those subjects!
